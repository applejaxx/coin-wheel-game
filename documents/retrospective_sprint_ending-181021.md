# Retrospective for sprint ending on 10/21/2018
-------------------------------------

### Comments from Jon
* I think we need to enhance our focus on setting a public deadline and then holding ourselves to it
* To Jody's point, this is projects is not pretend in any way. If we set a deadline and then miss it, what 
  are we communicating about our team?
* We are in near complete control of setting a deadline and setting what work is completed by that 
  deadline, so we have little valid excuse to miss
* Our experience so far may indicate we need to put even less work in each sprint. Our other 
  responsibilities are important and limit our time available for this project. 
* We also might be underestimating the time required to learn things like ant and read and incorporate 
  lessons from Clean Code
* My work style is to front load work early in a sprint and use the latter part of the sprint to fine tune 
  and organize. That may not be compatible with the realities we face with other commitments outside this class
* I feel that I am driving the process to much compared to the team driving it collectively. For the next
  sprint I would like to take a back seat and let other team members drive the process including
  * Initiate the sprint
  * Set the sprint deadline
  * Document user stories
  * Assign work via user stories
  * Assess progress and drive adjustments to make deadline
  * Make proposals and seek my feedback
  

### Comments from Mark
* Sprint timeframes may need to be adjusted to enhance the effectiveness of the work in the sprint being done.
  Also, we may have over shot the amount that can be put into a work load per sprint.
* Make it a point to get some face-to-face feedback from Dr. Paul after each sprint is over.
* I may have halted some progress due to not being on slack as much as my teammates. I need to work
  on this for future sprints. Also, I may need to be outspoken when participating in group discussions.
* For the next sprint I would suggest:
	* Better involvement on my side in group discussions
	* Structuring sprint work loads appropriately.
	* More real time communication with Dr. Paul 

### Comments from Jackie
* With the unreliability of class time to work in our groups, we need to focus on organization of 
  tasks so everyone is clear on what they can be working on during a sprint. 
* I think we may be overestimating what can be done in a sprint timeframe. We might need to pull back the 
  amount of user stories or tasks that can be achieved in the allotted time and create a more thorough breakdown 
  of those user stories to see what is achievable during a sprint. 
* We need to take into account how much time it takes to learn new subject matter.
* Due to commitments outside of class, we need to be understanding of when team members can realistically work 
  on their own tasks. Everyone has a different method of working and an outside schedule they must work around.
* For the next sprint, I would like to see:
	* A good estimate of a sprint timeframe 
	* Organization of tasks and user stories
	* Better breakdown of those tasks and user stories
	* Adjustments of those tasks and user stories to fit within the sprint
	* The continuation of the great communication we were able to achieve this last round
