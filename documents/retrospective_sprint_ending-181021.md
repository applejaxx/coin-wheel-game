# Retrospective for sprint ending on 10/21/2018
-------------------------------------

### Comments from Jon
* I think we need to enhance our focus on setting a public deadline and then holding ourselves to it
* To Jody's point, this is projects is not pretend in any way. If we set a deadline and then miss it, what 
  are we communicating about our team?
* We are in near complete control of setting a deadline and setting what work is completed by that 
  deadline, so we have little valid excuse to miss
* Our experience so far may indicate we need to put even less work in each sprint. Our other 
  responsibilities are important and limit our time available for this project. 
* We also might be underestimating the time required to learn things like ant and read and incorporate 
  lessons from Clean Code
* My work style is to front load work early in a sprint and use the latter part of the sprint to fine tune 
  and organize. That may not be compatible with the realities we face with other commitments outside this class
* I feel that I am driving the process to much compared to the team driving it collectively. For the next
  sprint I would like to take a back seat and let other team members drive the process including
  * Initiate the sprint
  * Set the sprint deadline
  * Document user stories
  * Assign work via user stories
  * Assess progress and drive adjustments to make deadline
  * Make proposals and seek my feedback
